# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that segments customers using
**RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).  
The objective is to identify **high-value**, **loyal**, and **at-risk customers** to support
data-driven marketing, retention, and customer engagement strategies.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses need a clear understanding of customer purchasing behavior in order to:
- identify customers contributing the most revenue,
- detect customers at risk of churn (not purchasing recently),
- prioritize retention and re-engagement efforts.

This dashboard answers key business questions such as:
- Who are the **Champions** (recent, frequent, high-spend customers)?
- Which customers are **At Risk** and should be re-engaged?
- How do sales and customer behavior vary by **time period** and **region**?

## Dataset
- **Sample – Superstore** (transactional retail dataset)
- Order-level data including:
  - Order Date
  - Customer ID and Customer Name
  - Sales, Profit
  - Category and Region
- Data preparation performed in **Power Query**:
  - Corrected data types
  - Removed invalid or blank customer records

---

## Tools & Skills
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** with advanced filter-context handling:
  - `CALCULATE`, `ALLEXCEPT`, `ALL`
  - `PERCENTILEX.INC`, `DATEDIFF`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`
- Dashboard design:
  - KPI cards
  - Bar charts
  - Date and categorical slicers
  - Customer-level RFM table

## Methodology: RFM Analysis

### RFM Metrics (per Customer)
- **Recency** – Days since the customer’s most recent purchase (lower is better)
- **Frequency** – Number of distinct orders placed (higher is better)
- **Monetary** – Total sales value generated by the customer (higher is better)

### Scoring
- Each R/F/M metric is scored from **1 to 5**
- Scores are assigned using **percentile-based thresholds** to ensure balanced segmentation

### Customer Segments
Customers are classified into business-friendly segments such as:
- **Champions**
- **Loyal Customers**
- **New / Promising**
- **Potential Loyalists**
- **At Risk (High Value)**
- **Hibernating / Lost**
- **Regular**

## Key DAX Measures (High Level)
> Full DAX logic is available inside the `.pbix` file.

- **Global reference date**
  - `AsOfDate = CALCULATE(MAX(Order Date), ALL(Table))`
- **Recency**
  - Difference between last purchase date and global reference date
- **Frequency**
  - `DISTINCTCOUNT(Order ID)` per customer
- **Monetary**
  - `SUM(Sales)` per customer
- **R / F / M Scores**
  - Percentile-based scoring using `PERCENTILEX.INC`
- **Customer Segmentation**
